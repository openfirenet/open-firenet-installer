**Open Firenet Installer** is the universal, cross-platform desktop GUI & CLI assistant to discover, flash, configure, and wirelessly update your **Open Firenet** dongle (the open-source ESP32-S3 replacement for the proprietary RIKA Firenet module).

Unlike WebSerial solutions (ESP Web Tools) that **fail completely on Mozilla Firefox and Apple Safari**, Open Firenet Installer runs natively across **Windows**, **macOS** (Apple Silicon & Intel), and **Linux** as a single, self-contained executable with zero external runtime dependencies (no Python or esptool installation needed).

### 3. USB Serial Flasher (Update & Factory Reset Modes)
Auto-detects plugged ESP32-S3 devices. Supports two flashing modes: **Update mode** (preserves Wi-Fi credentials and NVS settings) or **Full Factory Reset** (wipes and initializes flash memory).

## ✨ Key Features

- **🔍 Automatic Network Discovery**: Detects your stove in seconds via mDNS and active subnet probing. Retrieves live stove model (*DOMO*, *INDUO*, etc.), operating status, IP address, and signal strength.
- **📡 Pure Rust ArduinoOTA Wireless Flasher**: Built-in, high-speed pure Rust OTA client eliminating Python or external script requirements. Automatically polls for the device to restart and come back online.
- **⚡ USB Serial Flasher with Safe Dual Modes**:
  - **Update Mode** (offset `0x10000`): Updates application firmware while preserving your stored Wi-Fi credentials and configuration.
  - **Full Reset / Factory Mode** (offset `0x0000`): Flashes a complete factory image onto new ESP32-S3 chips or for clean reinstalls.
- **🔒 Cryptographic Integrity & Security**: Official firmware binaries are verified using **Minisign** digital signatures against the official Open Firenet community public key before flashing.
- **📶 Guided USB Wi-Fi Setup**: Provision Wi-Fi credentials over serial with a single click or terminal command. The installer waits for the dongle's confirmation.
- **🔑 Update Password** (dongle firmware 4.0 or later): set or remove, over USB, a password that the dongle then asks for at each wireless update. The installer asks for it when the dongle has one.
- **📟 Embedded Serial Monitor**: Monitor live stove UART dialogue frames and boot logs directly inside your terminal.
- **🌐 Multilingual**: Built-in support for **English**, **French**, **German** and **Italian**.
- **🖥️ Dual Mode (GUI & CLI)**: Automatically launches a sleek, modern Tauri graphical interface in desktop environments, or falls back to an interactive menu / command-line tool in headless/SSH setups.

## 📥 Downloads & Releases

Pre-compiled standalone binaries and packages are available on the [**GitHub Releases**](https://github.com/openfirenet/open-firenet-installer/releases) page:

| Operating System & Architecture | Binary / Package Name | Description |
|---|---|---|
| **Linux (Universal)** | `open-firenet-installer-linux-x86_64.AppImage` | Universal AppImage (All Linux distros, self-contained) |
| **Linux (Debian / Ubuntu / Mint)** | `open-firenet-installer-linux-amd64.deb` | Native Debian package (Desktop integration & icons) |
| **Linux (CLI / Raw ELF)** | `open-firenet-installer-linux-x86_64` | Standalone ELF 64-bit executable |
| **Windows (x86_64)** | `open-firenet-installer-windows-x86_64.exe` | Standalone `.exe` executable |
| **macOS Apple Silicon (M1/M2/M3/M4)** | `open-firenet-installer-macos-arm64` | Standalone Mach-O arm64 |
| **macOS Intel (x86_64)** | `open-firenet-installer-macos-x86_64` | Standalone Mach-O x86_64 |

> [!IMPORTANT]
> **Your computer may warn you at the first start.** The installer is not signed with a paid publisher certificate, so Windows and macOS do not know it. This is expected.
> - **Windows**: on the blue "Windows protected your PC" screen (Microsoft Defender SmartScreen), click **More info**, then **Run anyway**.
> - **macOS**: the file is a plain program. In the Terminal, make it executable (`chmod +x open-firenet-installer-macos-arm64`), then start it. If macOS says it cannot be opened or that its developer cannot be verified, open **System Settings > Privacy & Security** and click **Open Anyway**.
>
> To check that the file is the genuine one, compare its SHA-256 with the `SHA256SUMS` file published with each release.

> [!TIP]
> **Linux users**: Ensure your user belongs to the `dialout` or `uucp` group to access USB serial ports:
> ```bash
> sudo usermod -aG dialout $USER
> # Log out and log back in for changes to take effect
> ```

> [!NOTE]
> **Native USB boards (M5Stamp S3, Seeed Studio XIAO ESP32-S3)**:
> - **Bootloader entry**: If connection to the serial port fails, hold down the physical **BOOT** button while plugging in the USB cable to enter the Espressif ROM download mode.
> - **Post-flash restart**: Boards without a dedicated USB-to-UART chip cannot be reset automatically over USB DTR/RTS. Press the physical **RESET** button on the board once flashing completes to launch Open Firenet.
> - **Wi-Fi alternative**: On boards without a hardware UART bridge, you can also configure Wi-Fi by connecting directly to the fallback access point **`Open-Firenet-Setup`** (`192.168.4.1`).

## 🌐 Network Requirements (Discovery & Wireless OTA)

Discovery and wireless updates are designed for a home network where the computer and the dongle are on the **same subnet**. On segmented networks (VLANs, guest Wi-Fi, port security, strict firewalls), they may not work out of the box:

- **Discovery** queries mDNS (`openfirenet.local`) and probes the computer's own subnet (`x.x.x.1`–`x.x.x.254`) over HTTP (port 80). A dongle on another subnet is not found automatically; use its IP address directly (e.g. `ota --ip 192.168.20.15`).
- **Wireless OTA** works in both directions:
  1. the installer sends an invitation to the dongle on **UDP port 3232**;
  2. the dongle then **connects back to the computer over TCP**, on a random port opened by the installer, to download the firmware (it must succeed within 12 seconds).

  The second step is the one usually blocked: the dongle must be allowed to open a connection to the computer, and the computer's firewall must accept incoming connections from the local network.

If an update fails with a timeout, put the computer on the same subnet as the dongle (or allow the traffic above), or update over USB instead.
